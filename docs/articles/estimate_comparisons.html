<p>Redistribution means rearranging values such that totals remain the
same, and the original distribution could be recovered when
re-aggregating from a perfectly contained disaggregate.</p>
<p>This may be desirable if your goal is to simply display the same data
in different forms.</p>
<p>If, however, your goal is to come up with values at scales you don’t
have observations of, it may be desirable to combine various
observations at different scales and use them to come up with new
estimates.</p>
<p>In the case of estimation, there are many more methods to consider,
and validating their results is less straightforward, so this article
will consider a few estimation and validation methods.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we’ll want to use these methods to get values for
unobserved geographies, but for this comparison of methods, we’ll want a
way to test their results against known values.</p>
<p>For this test case, we can simply start at a higher geolayer, and
make estimates at the block group level. To do that, we’ll need to
aggregate our block group data up to tracts:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">tracts</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/redistribute.html">redistribute</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">block_groups</span>, <span class="va">geography_tr</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="redistribution">Redistribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#redistribution"></a>

<p>As a baseline, the first method to consider is proportional
redistribution of the block group summary estimates alone.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="direct">Direct<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#direct"></a>

<p>We could do this from tracts to block groups directly:</p>

<p>We can see in this case, the error introduce when we only have
proportional information at the lower level; block groups that once
varied within tract now have the same value:</p>

<p>In this case, the difference mostly comes down to two buildings with
many units that get less relative weight with the resident values.</p>

</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve used some additional information (total units) at the
parcel level to improve the distribution of values across block groups,
relative to a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>We have some more information at the parcel level, such as unit type
and number of renter versus owner designations, but to make use of this
information, we need some association between source values and those
features. This is where the census microdata sample can come in: The
Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) consists of individual-level
observations that include demographic features and housing features.</p>

<p>The PUM sample is only located down to PUM areas, which are made up
of tracts, so this is where we can start for a baseline.</p>
<p>We will use associations between demographic and housing features
within each PUMA to get probabilities at the parcel level, then
redistribute our source values to them like before.</p>
<p>The first step to this end is to prepare our data so it is easy to
associate the individual PUMS variables with their per-level summaries
at the tract level:</p>

variables, but we also have household-level information, so we might try
to account for this as well by first adjusting the household weights,

<p>The two-step approach still mainly focuses on better aligning the
person-level weights – the household totals only match after the first
step, but are not considered in the second step. Alternative to this, we
might try to match the household- and person-level weights at the same
time with a generalized raking approach:</p>

<p>So far, we’ve used the same data at different initial geolayers as a
way to introduce error while still having a known target to measure
error from. This may have the benefit of retaining some properties of
the data that affect our methods in unknown ways, but the down side is
that we cannot very directly measure error, and we are testing against
estimates with their own error.</p>
<p>An alternative is to simulate the initial population, then draw
samples from that population to form simulated version of the data we
have available (sparse PUM samples, and less sparse block group
summaries). Then, instead of having to go down to parcels and back up to
artificially unknown intermediate layers (block groups) to measure
error, we can measure directly at the parcel level.</p>

<p>Now we can look at results from a single sample. These are not
comparable to the other results because (a) they are simulated
independently from the real samples (so, for instance, the race category
baselines are randomized), and (b) error is measured at the parcel
level, rather than the block group level.</p>
