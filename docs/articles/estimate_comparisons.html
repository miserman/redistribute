<p>Redistribution means rearranging values such that totals remain the
same, and the original distribution could be recovered when
re-aggregating from a perfectly contained disaggregate.</p>
<p>This may be desirable if your goal is to simply display the same data
in different forms.</p>
<p>If, however, your goal is to come up with values at scales you don’t
have observations of, it may be desirable to combine various
observations at different scales and use them to come up with new
estimates.</p>
<p>In the case of estimation, there are many more methods to consider,
and validating their results is less straightforward, so this article
will consider a few estimation and validation methods.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we’ll want to use these methods to get values for
unobserved geographies, but for this comparison of methods, we’ll want a
way to test their results against known values.</p>
<p>For this test case, we can simply start at a higher geolayer, and
make estimates at the block group level. To do that, we’ll need to
aggregate our block group data up to tracts:</p>

<p>So far, we’ve used some additional information (total units) at the
parcel level to improve the distribution of values across block groups,
relative to a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>We have some more information at the parcel level, such as unit type
and number of renter versus owner designations, but to make use of this
information, we need some association between source values and those
features. This is where the census microdata sample can come in: The
Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) consists of individual-level
observations that include demographic features and housing features.</p>

<p>The PUM sample is only located down to PUM areas, which are made up
of tracts, so this is where we can start for a baseline.</p>
<p>We will use associations between demographic and housing features
within each PUMA to get probabilities at the parcel level, then
redistribute our source values to them like before.</p>
<p>The first step to this end is to prepare our data so it is easy to
associate the individual PUMS variables with their per-level summaries
